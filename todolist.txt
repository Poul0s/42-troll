// scripts todolist


- full disk
	-> script that add random files everywhere in the home folders
		-> pick name of another real file (but dont remplace it)

- communism mode
	-> set language as russian
	-> set keyboard layout in russian
	-> set communism wallpaper
	-> change color theme in red



## ideas

gsettings check org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.*
